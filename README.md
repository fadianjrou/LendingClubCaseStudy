## General Info
    The analysis uses historical data set provided by the lending club and identifies categorical and continious variables and their influence on on the risk of Defaulting. The analysis is based on historical data of old loans that are either fully paid, or defaulted. Current loans are excluded from the analysis as they can't considered as defaulted

## Technologies Used
    The Analysis uses Python, Pandas, numpy, and plot to manipulate, analyse and visualize the data and the risk probability of Defaulting.

## Conclusions
    The Analysis provides the Lending Club with a clear vision of all parameters and their effects on default
